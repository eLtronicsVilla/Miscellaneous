''' decorator1.py   
This is the file to write the script for the decorators.

Decorator is used to decorate a function.
Add that extra code to your old function.

Create a brand new function that contains the code , and then add
new code to that.
	
Using decorator you will be able to tack extra functionality to already existing function
 
They add @ to place them on top of the original function.

Build our own decorator manually
